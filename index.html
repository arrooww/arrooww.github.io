            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Franz Kafka "The Metamorphosis"</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">May 1, 2023 by <a href="#">Franz Kafka</a></p>

            <p>Enough about Pes Patron. Let's read Franz Kafka's book "The Metamorphosis"</p>
            <hr>
            <p>"What's happened to me?" he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular human room, only a little on the small side, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. Over the table, on which an unpacked line of fabric samples was all spread out--Samsa was a traveling salesman--hung the picture which he had recently cut out of a glossy magazine and lodged in a pretty gilt frame. It showed a lady done up in a fur hat and a fur boa, sitting upright and raising up against the viewer a heavy fur muff in which her whole forearm had disappeared.</p>
            <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
            <p>Gregor's eyes then turned to the window, and the overcast weather--he could hear raindrops hitting against the metal window ledge--completely depressed him. "How about going back to sleep for a few minutes and forgetting all this nonsense," he thought, but that was completely impracticable, since he was used to sleeping on his right side and in his present state could not get into that position. </p>
            <h3>What's next?</h3>
            <p>No matter how hard he threw himself onto his right side, he always rocked onto his back again. He must have tried it a hundred times, closing his eyes so as not to have to see his squirming legs, and stopped only when he began to feel a slight, dull pain in his side, which he had never felt before.</p>
            <h3>"Oh God,"</h3>
            <p>he thought, "what a grueling job I've picked! Day in, day out--on the road. The upset of doing business is much worse than the actual business in the home office, and, besides, I've got the torture of traveling, worrying about changing trains, eating miserable food at all hours, constantly seeing new faces, no relationships that last or get more intimate. To the devil with it all!" </p>
            <p>He felt a slight itching up on top of his belly; shoved himself slowly on his back closer to the bedpost, so as to be able to lift his head better; found the itchy spot, studded with small white dots which he had no idea what to make of; and wanted to touch the spot with one of his legs but immediately pulled it back, for the contact sent a cold shiver through him.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Lasagna recipe</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">April 23, 2023 by <a href="#">Chef Kris</a></p>
            <p>The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly 
              customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. 
              If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the 
              ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
              <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
              <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
              <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
              <li>Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            </ul>
              <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven 
                preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes, 
                then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important 
                to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you 
                cut into it.</p>
